# cub3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way. It's implemented in C using the raycasting technique and the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42) library.
